# Recycling-Waste-in-NY
## Project Goal & Task

The main goal was to analyze patterns in recycling activities across New York, diving into both regional and statewide data. Using Python libraries, I discovered some interesting insights about recycling compared to waste generation, and I created interactive data visualizations to share those findings in a way that's easy to understand. In the end, I had the chance to present everything to the  members of Codable, showing them how to explore the interactive website and gain similar insights from EDA. 

### Tasks Involved:

- Data Cleaning: Import and filter a dataset on recycled commodities and waste streams.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Separate the data into regional and statewide subsets, pivot data to compare different recycling types over time, and create visual comparisons.
- Visualization Creation: Use tools such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to effectively plot trends, and build a dynamic interactive dashboard/website using Tableau, Flourish, and Canva.

## EDA Summary

1. **Regional Analysis**
    - Filtering: Isolating data for “Region - Capital”
    - Pivoting: Reshaping the data to compare recycling and waste amounts across fiscal years.
    - Visualization: The regional graph shows that in earlier fiscal years, recycling tonnage significantly exceeded waste tonnage, indicating a strong focus on recycling. Over time, both recycling and waste tonnages declined, and the gap between them narrowed. This change may be due to altered regional collection strategies, decreased overall material amount, shifting definitions of what constitutes recycled versus waste material. It underscores the importance of analyzing local practices and policy impacts.

2. **Statewide Analysis**
    - Filtering: Focusing on percentage data (e.g., “Overall Waste Stream Reduction, Percentage” and “Percentage of Waste Stream Recycled”).
    - Visualization: The statewide graph shows that the recycling % typically remains between 40-60% while the overall waste reduction varies significantly each year. Notably, there’s a dramatic drop around 2018-2019, possibly due to increased waste generation or changes in reporting, followed by a sharp spike in 2020-2021. While the recycling rate is stable, the efficiency of waste reduction has experienced both challenges and improvements. 

## Description of Approach

**Integrating EDA and Interactive Visualizations:** 

- Python for EDA: Provides a comprehensive overview of recycling trends through data cleaning, filtering, pivoting, and visualization.
- Visualization Tools: Create dynamic graphs and animated visualizations using Tableau and Flourish, and combines these visual elements with narrative text to create an engaging interactive website.

The [resulting website](https://codable-recycling-fa23.my.canva.site/data-visualization-project#page-8) allows users to further explore these insights without any knowledge in Python, making the data accessible and actionable. 

## Conclusion

The Recycling in New York project follows a clear process from data collection to analysis and interactive visual storytelling. It filters and pivots data for regional and statewide comparisons, presenting trends through clear, annotated charts to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into recycling trends over fiscal years. The interactive website allows users to explore the data and discover insights from my exploratory data analysis without any coding required. I presented this project at the general meeting of the student organization called Codable.
